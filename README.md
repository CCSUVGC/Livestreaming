# CCSU Video Gaming Club Livestreaming Templates

In this repo, you will find all the OBS Scene Collections for the Video Gaming Club Streams.
We reccomend you use [OBS Studio](https://www.obsproject.com/), as it is the top livestream program out there! (It's also open source!)

## Stream Tools
For events such as Riptide, we have our own custom variation of a Stream Tool called TournamentStreamHelper. You can find the link to that repo [here](https://www.github.com/CCSUVGC/TournamentStreamHelper).

## Guides
Guides are in the [Wiki](https://www.github.com/CCSUVGC/Livestreaming/wiki).
