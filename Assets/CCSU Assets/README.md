# IMPORTANT!
The Video Gaming Club is **NOT** allowed to use any CCSU Esports or CCSU Logo's unless we get direct approval for that purpose. 

## But why?
We don't want to get in trouble, as the moment we add that on our overlay's it becomes a stream that gets tied directly back to CCSU as a school sponsored thing, and then the restrictions come down on the stream. So to be safe, don't add it unless you are 1,000% sure that what you are doing is alright. (maybe run it by Duane first)

TLDR: CCSU Logos means more responsibility as it means you are actually representing the school. (Its kinda like the CCSU tags in game issues we have had.)

If you are using a non-esports CCSU logo, check the Logo & Design Treatment page [here](https://www.ccsu.edu/webguide/styleGuide/logo.html) before continuing to make sure everything lines up to code.
