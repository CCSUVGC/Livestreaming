# Assets Folder
This folder contains all the logos and backgrounds we actively use. Here is a quick guide to it all.

## Logos
All logo files begin with LOGO_XXX.png. For instance, LOGO_NORMAL.png is our standard logo that we use everywhere, so that may be useful for you.

Be sure to watch out for backgrounds that may be solid, as that may not fit well with OBS unless a mask is prepared.

## Banners / Backgrounds
Background files also have some of our files.
